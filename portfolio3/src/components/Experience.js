                            <p>I worked on the software functionality of the company’s enterprise warehouse management application.
                        
                                 My responsibility was primarily to debug and add various new features into the existing
                                application. Much of the work was done in .Net Framework.
                        
                        
                                 I worked on the development of a new application that aims to cut out the middleman in the
                             Software-Support process and handles much of the queries and diagnostics automatically.
